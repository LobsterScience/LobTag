Andrew Kehoe,  
 \newline  
Thanks for returning the snow crab tag caught last season. I have included a token of our appreciation for your efforts in returning this information. I have also included a chart showing the release and recapture positions for the tag. The information provided by such tagging recaptures is helpful in determining the movement of snow crab throughout the Scotian Shelf.   
 \newline  
The tagged crab you caught was tagged in the 2017 season.  
 \newline  
Thank you for releasing all tagged crab back to the water alive after recording the tag number and relevant information such as date and location of capture. The data you submitted will be treated in the same manner as when we receive the actual tag. We hope that additional knowledge will be gained by tracking subsequent recaptures of individual crab over time.   
 \newline  
I have included a one page information sheet on our tagging program. On the reverse side of this sheet is a form which can easily be used to record all required information on any tagged crab you may catch in the future. This entire form can be mailed to DFO Science at the end of the snow crab season.  
 \newline  
  Thanks for your help.

Thanks for returning the snow crab tag caught last season. I have included a token of our appreciation for your efforts in returning this information. I have also included a chart showing the release and recapture positions for the tag. The information provided by such tagging recaptures is helpful in determining the movement of snow crab throughout the Scotian Shelf.   
 \newline  
The tagged crab you caught was tagged in the 2016 season.  
 \newline  
Thank you for releasing all tagged crab back to the water alive after recording the tag number and relevant information such as date and location of capture. The data you submitted will be treated in the same manner as when we receive the actual tag. We hope that additional knowledge will be gained by tracking subsequent recaptures of individual crab over time.   
 \newline  
I have included a one page information sheet on our tagging program. On the reverse side of this sheet is a form which can easily be used to record all required information on any tagged crab you may catch in the future. This entire form can be mailed to DFO Science at the end of the snow crab season.  
 \newline  
  Thanks for your help.
